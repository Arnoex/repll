### repll: node repl module's livly implementation

- `r`: **read** input key-by-key ( when you paste something, don't worry, we will handle it )
- `e`: **evaluate** input ( we do not evaluate javascript, that's boring,the eval function is provided by you )
- `p`: **print** whatever you wanna output
- `ll`: we doing `r e p` **looply** and **livly**, so it can interact with user in real-time
